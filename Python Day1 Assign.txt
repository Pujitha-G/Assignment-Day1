1) After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
    
    bacon = 22
    bacon + 1

  -->Bacon has 22



2) What should the values of the following two terms be?
    'spam' + 'spamspam'
    'spam' * 3

Output: spamspamspam
             spamspamspam

3) How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

  Break:    Break will terminate the execution of the current loop and passes the control to the next statement.
  Continue:   Continue will skip/jumps off to the very next condition and continue the execution of the loop statement.



4) In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

In a for loop,
  range(10) gives output as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
  range(0,10) gives output as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
  range(0,10,1) gives output as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

The syntax is 
        range(start, stop [,step])

The difference is
 range(10) has only stop value i.e., 10
 range(0,10) has both start and stop values i.e., start=0, stop=10
 range(0,10,1) has start, stop and step values i.e., start=0, stop=10 and step=1.


5) Using a for loop, write a short programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10 Then, using a while loop, create an identical programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10.

#Program to print numbers 1 to 10 Using for loop

for i in range(1,11)
print(i)

#Program to print numbers 1 to 10 Using While loop

inp=1
while(inp<=10)
 print(inp)
inp+=1


6) Given a number x, determine whether the given number is Armstrong number or not.

    Input : 153
    Output : Yes
    153 is an Armstrong number.
    1 * 1 * 1 + 5 * 5 * 5 + 3 * 3 * 3 = 153

#Program to determine the number is Armstrong or not
num,sum=153,0
temp=num
while(temp>0)
 r=temp%10
sum+=r**3
temp= temp/10
  if(num==sum):
print("Yes")
else:
Print("No")


  
 7) Program to find Sum of squares of first n natural numbers.

def squaresum(n) :
 
    sm = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1) :
        sm = sm + (i * i)
     
    return sm



8) Program to Reverse words in a given String in Python.

#Program to Reverse words in a given String 

string= "I am handsome boy"
words= string.split()
words= list(reversed(words))
print(" ".join(words))

   
9) Given a list of numbers, write a Python program to find the sum of all the elements in the list.
    Input: [10,12,13]
    Output: 35

#Program to find sum of all elements in the list

Total =0
list1=[10,12,13]
for ele in range(0, len(list1))
Total+=list1(ele)
print(Total)


10) Write a Python program to print all even numbers between 10-1000.

#Program to print all even numbers between 10-1000

for num in range(10,1000)
if num%2==0
print(num)
